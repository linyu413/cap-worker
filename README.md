Cap Worker is a backend server built on Cloudflare workers. It uses a modern open-source CAPTCHA alternative based on SHA-256 proof-of-work. It protects services from automated traffic and DDoS while remaining lightweight and verifiable. This project embraces open standards, fast execution, and a minimal attack surface. The core idea is simple: require clients to perform a small amount of computational work that proves they are human enough to proceed, but without the burden of traditional CAPTCHAs.

Why Cap Worker exists üöÄ
Cap Worker targets sites and services that need fast, scalable protection against automated traffic without relying on bulky image challenges or external services. The system leverages the speed and edge-caching of Cloudflare Workers to deliver a tiny, deterministic PoW-based CAPTCHA. It reduces bandwidth usage and server load while maintaining a clear, auditable proof-of-work mechanism.

Key motivations:
- Reduce user friction while preserving security.
- Leverage edge compute for fast challenge generation and verification.
- Provide a transparent, auditable alternative to third-party CAPTCHA services.
- Allow self-hosting with clear, open-source tooling.

How Cap Worker works üß†
Cap Worker uses a SHA-256 proof-of-work as the CAPTCHA challenge. A client requesting protection receives a challenge with a difficulty level and a short salt. The client computes a nonce that, when combined with the challenge, yields a hash below a target threshold. The client sends the nonce back to the server, where the hash is recomputed and validated. If the hash meets the difficulty requirement, the client passes the test and proceeds to the protected resource.

The workflow in plain terms:
- Client asks for a challenge.
- Server returns a challenge string, a difficulty value, and a salt.
- Client computes a nonce that makes hash(challenge + nonce + salt) fall below a target.
- Client submits the nonce back to the server.
- Server validates the hash with the same challenge and salt.
- If valid, the client receives authorization or access to the requested resource.

Core concepts and design goals üß≠
- Simplicity: A small, understandable proof-of-work puzzle replaces traditional CAPTCHA prompts.
- Speed: Edge-based verification minimizes latency and keeps user experience snappy.
- Security: The challenge is random, unique per session, and tied to a salt to prevent replay.
- Stateless verification: The worker can verify proofs without maintaining heavy per-user state.
- Extensibility: The architecture supports additional validation checks, rate limits, and pluggable policies.
- Observability: Clear logging and metrics for validation attempts, failures, and performance.

Features at a glance ‚ú®
- SHA-256 based CAPTCHA: Lightweight, verifiable, and deterministic.
- Cloudflare Workers deployment: Edge-friendly, fast to deploy, scalable.

Usage patterns and recommended workflows
- Edge-first security posture
  Cap Worker is designed to run on the edge. It minimizes the distance between the user and the authority that decides whether to allow access. This reduces latency, improves user experience, and lowers the risk of DDoS or volumetric abuse on your origin servers.

- Progressive hardening
  Start with a low difficulty and small TTL for challenges. Monitor abuse indicators, performance, and user experience. Gradually increase difficulty to match traffic patterns. Adjust rate limits to balance protection with accessibility.

- Compatibility considerations
  - If you already use a CAPTCHA provider, Cap Worker serves as a drop-in enhancement at the edge rather than a wholesale replacement of your entire authentication or verification stack.
  - The PoW-based CAPTCHA is language-agnostic. Any client that can perform SHA-256 hashing can solve the puzzle, making it suitable for a wide range of devices and clients.

- Developer experience
  - The codebase favors clarity over clever tricks.
  - Tests cover core PoW generation and verification logic, along with edge-case handling for timeouts and invalid payloads.
  - There are explicit integration tests that simulate client-server interactions with the deployed edge runtime.

Endpoint references and example payloads
- Challenge endpoint (example)
  - Path: /challenge
  - Method: GET
  - Response example:
    {
      "challenge": "f3a9b8d4c6e2a1b7",
      "salt": "7d3f9c1a",
      "difficulty": 20,
      "expires_in": 300
    }

- Submit proof endpoint (example)
  - Path: /verify
  - Method: POST
  - Request body:
    {
      "challenge": "f3a9b8d4c6e2a1b7",
      "nonce": "105423",
      "hash": "1a2b3c4d5e6f..."
    }
  - Response (success):
    {
      "ok": true,
      "message": "Proof accepted",
      "token": "jwt-or-session-id"
    }
  - Response (failure):
    {
      "ok": false,
      "error": "Invalid proof"
    }

- Security and policy decisions in API
  - The challenge includes a random salt for each session.
  - The client‚Äôs nonce must be unique per challenge to prevent replay.
  - The server enforces a TTL to reduce stale proofs.
  - Logs capture outcome and hash checks for auditability.

Architecture deep dive
- Edge compute model
  Cap Worker leverages Cloudflare Workers to host the challenge generator, verifier, and access gate. This moves protection logic closer to clients and reduces network hops. The edge-only approach minimizes latencies and reduces attack surfaces on your origin infrastructure.

- Stateless design
  The verifier does not need to store every accepted challenge. It validates based on the challenge, salt, and nonce. The ephemeral state is kept short and disposed after the TTL. This design simplifies scaling and reduces memory pressure.

- Data flows
  1) Client requests a challenge.
  2) Worker responds with challenge, salt, and difficulty.
  3) Client computes nonce and hash.
  4) Client submits proof to /verify.
  5) Worker validates. If valid, access is granted.

- Observability and metrics
  - Request latency is measured end-to-end.
  - Validation success and failure counts are tracked.
  - Abnormal activity patterns trigger rate limiting or automatic lockdowns.
  - Security events (invalid proofs, replay attempts) are logged with context.

- Fail-safe and fallback
  If a challenge cannot be generated due to a transient issue, the system can fall back to a safe default state and present a minimal barrier (or ask the client to retry). This ensures service availability while protecting against abuse.

- Extensibility points
  - Additional proofs: You can replace or supplement SHA-256 PoW with other lightweight puzzles.
  - Pluggable rate limits: Swap in different strategies for per-IP, per-origin, or per-user throttling.
  - Custom verification rules: Add platform-specific checks or identity-based gating.

Security patterns you can implement
- HMAC-based verification
  Combine a server-side secret with the challenge to generate additional verification tokens without exposing the secret to clients.

- Short-lived tokens
  Issue tokens only after a valid PoW. Tokens should expire quickly if unused to minimize risk.

- Nonce reuse protection
  Treat each nonce as unique per challenge to avoid replay. Maintain a small in-memory window for recent nonces if needed.

- DDoS resilience
  Rate limits stay active even under high load. The edge layer helps absorb bursts before they reach the origin.

Performance considerations
- Latency budget
  Edge-based verification yields low latency, but you should monitor the time to generate challenges and verify proofs under load. Cap the difficulty to maintain predictable response times.

- Resource usage
  The SHA-256 hashing is inexpensive on modern hardware. The main cost is network round-trips and Python/JavaScript runtimes if you use a separate verification service. The design minimizes server-side compute.

- Scaling strategy
  Cloudflare Workers scale automatically with demand, but you should plan for:
  - Logs and metrics storage for long-term analyses
  - Backpressure handling if a sudden surge triggers rate limits
  - Redundancy across regions to reduce miss rates

Concrete example scenario
- Your site handles millions of requests per day. You want to deter automated traffic without turning away humans with clumsy challenges.
- You deploy Cap Worker to your Cloudflare account. You configure a low initial difficulty and a short TTL for challenges.
- A user‚Äôs browser requests a protected resource. The edge generates a challenge and sends it to the browser.
- The browser computes a nonce that satisfies the PoW condition and sends it back to the edge.
- The edge verifies the PoW and, if valid, allows the user to access the resource. Logging records the outcome.
- Over weeks, you observe traffic patterns, adjust difficulty, and refine rate limits as needed.

Environment compatibility notes
- Platform support
  Cap Worker is designed to work with Cloudflare Workers. It should be compatible with other edge runtimes that support similar JavaScript execution environments, provided the APIs align with the project‚Äôs design.

- Language and tooling
  The core codebase uses JavaScript/TypeScript-friendly workflows. You can adapt tooling to your preferred ecosystem as long as the edge execution model remains the same.

- Integrations
  Cap Worker can be integrated with various backends, from simple static sites to complex API gateways. Its callbacks and endpoints are designed to be adaptable to many architectures.

- Security posture for different regions
  When deploying across multiple regions, consider local risk profiles, legal requirements, and user expectations. Tailor rate limits and TTLs per region to reflect local traffic characteristics.

Final notes
- This README is designed to be thorough and practical. It emphasizes clarity and a calm, confident tone.
- The approach focuses on edge efficiency, clean architecture, and a strong emphasis on observability.
- If you need adjustments for a specific use case, you can tailor the configuration, endpoints, and policies without breaking the underlying PoW CAPTCHA concept.
